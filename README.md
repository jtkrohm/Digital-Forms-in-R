**This GitHub repository (<https://github.com/jtkrohm/Digital-Forms-in-R>) contains source code for all my custom digital forms.
**


Each form provides a graphical user interface, and allows users to manually log their
information into an integrated document database using mongoDB



# Form: Line Bottle Testing

This form is optimised for beverage manufacturing.
The user interface contains three tabs:

 - **first tab**: displays data entry with fields such as time, bottle size, fill height and weight
 - **second tab**: Displays a table with the most recent form entries 
 that have been saved
 - **third tab**: Displays a graph which shows the variation of a single bottle metric using information from all the form entries
